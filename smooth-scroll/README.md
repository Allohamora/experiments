# smooth-scroll experiment

## goals:
1. [x] create smooth-scroll
2. [] check scroll-behavior: smooth.
3. [] check window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth' }).

## my smooth-scroll
1. [x] vertical scroll
2. [x] horizontal scroll
3. [x] easy function support
* Maybe on mobile this doesn't work, because chrome dev tools in mobile mode shows window.pageYOffset and analogs === 0 in any state. And chrome dev tools shows torn fps when click on anchor tag.
